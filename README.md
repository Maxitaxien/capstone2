# Project description and info
Capstone project 2 from the course "Python for Machine Learning &amp; Data Science Masterclass" on Udemy. The project uses customer data for exploratory data analysis on the churn rate of Telco customers.

The code largely follows along on solving tasks given in the course. However, all code written is my own, and additional analysis is carried out beyond the course content.
